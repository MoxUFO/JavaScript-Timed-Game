# JavaScript-Timed-Game

## Description

do you know javascript? do you want to put it to the test? come take a quick quiz to test yoour JavasScript knowledge.
did i mentioned you are also timed, so no searching the "inter-web" for answers.

this was a fun and Challenging assignment. it really tested my knowledge of the fundimentals. The sweet highs amoungst* 
the lows are what kept me inspired to reach the end, even if that end may look different than others. no matter the end,
this project was my first javascript built from scratch and it felt good to see someting i put together work. this project
has taught me to realy pay attention to the details and how to think different, to the see the small and the large picture.
